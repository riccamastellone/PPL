-- Define a function smap that takes an infinite list L of Int, a function f from Int to Int, an operation OP
-- over Int, and a threshold T. smap performs a map of f on L, while keeping an accumulator K (with
-- starting value 0), which is updated at each step as oldAccumulatorValue OP f(currentElementOfL).
-- smap stops when the value of K reaches T and returns a list of all the computed values of the map.
-- E.g. smap (^2) (+) [1,2..] 100 is the list [1,4,9,16,25,36,49].
-- Write smapâ€™s type.
